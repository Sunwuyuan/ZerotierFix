# Implementation Details: Material 3 UI Redesign and ZTncui Integration

## Overview

This implementation adds a Material 3-styled current network card at the top of the main screen and integrates support for ZTncui server management.

## Key Changes

### 1. UI Layouts

#### New Layouts Created:
- **card_current_network.xml**: Material 3 card displaying the currently connected network with a switch to control connection
- **dialog_network_switch.xml**: Dialog for switching between networks (foundation for future implementation)
- **list_item_network_dialog.xml**: List item layout for network selection dialog
- **list_item_device.xml**: List item for displaying devices from ZTncui

#### Modified Layouts:
- **fragment_network_list.xml**: 
  - Added ScrollView to accommodate multiple sections
  - Integrated current network card at the top
  - Added device list section (hidden by default, shown when ZTncui is configured)
  - Reorganized layout structure to support new components

### 2. String Resources

Added new string resources for:
- ZTncui configuration (URL, username, password)
- Network switching dialog
- Device list display
- Status messages

### 3. Preferences

Added ZTncui settings in `preferences.xml`:
- Enable/disable ZTncui integration
- Server URL configuration
- Username and password fields

### 4. API Integration

#### Created `ZtncuiApiClient.java`:
- REST API client for ZTncui server communication
- Login authentication with token management
- Device list retrieval
- Error handling and logging

#### Created `ZtDevice.java`:
- Model class for network device/member information
- Properties: nodeId, name, online status, IP addresses

### 5. NetworkListFragment Updates

#### New UI Elements:
- `currentNetworkCard`: Material 3 card showing current network
- `currentNetworkName`: TextView for network name
- `currentNetworkId`: TextView for network ID
- `currentNetworkSwitch`: Switch to control network connection
- `deviceListSection`: Section for ZTncui device list (future use)

#### New Methods:
- `updateCurrentNetworkCard(Long networkId)`: Updates the UI to reflect current network state
  - Shows network name and ID when connected
  - Shows "No network connected" when disconnected
  - Handles switch state synchronization
  - Provides disconnect functionality

#### Modified Methods:
- `onCreateView()`: 
  - Initializes new UI elements
  - Sets up click listeners for network card
  - Wires up network state observer

### 6. Material 3 Design

The implementation follows Material 3 design guidelines:
- Uses MaterialCardView with elevated style
- Uses SwitchMaterial for modern switches
- Implements proper text appearances (TitleMedium, BodyLarge, etc.)
- Uses theme colors and proper spacing
- Provides tactile feedback with ripple effects

## Current Functionality

### Working Features:
1. **Current Network Display**: Shows the currently connected network in a prominent card at the top
2. **Connection Status**: Visual indicator (switch) shows connection state
3. **Quick Disconnect**: Users can tap the switch to disconnect from current network
4. **Network Information**: Displays network name and ID for connected network
5. **ZTncui Settings**: Users can configure ZTncui server details in preferences

### Partially Implemented:
1. **Network Switching Dialog**: Layout created but dialog logic needs full implementation
2. **Device List**: API client and layouts created but not fully integrated yet

## Future Enhancements

### Network Switching Dialog:
- Show all available networks in a dialog when tapping the network card
- Allow quick switching between networks
- Provide "Add Network" button in dialog

### ZTncui Device List:
- Activate device list when ZTncui is configured
- Load devices from ZTncui API in background
- Display device list below current network card
- Show device status (online/offline)
- Refresh device list periodically

### Additional Features:
- Pull-to-refresh for device list
- Device detail view
- Network statistics from ZTncui
- Push notifications for device status changes

## Technical Notes

### Thread Safety:
- API calls are performed on background threads
- UI updates are marshaled to main thread using `runOnUiThread()`
- Network state changes are observed via LiveData

### State Management:
- Network connection state is managed through NetworkListModel
- UI automatically updates when connection state changes
- Switch state is synchronized programmatically to prevent conflicts

### Error Handling:
- API errors are logged for debugging
- Failed ZTncui connections gracefully hide device list
- UI remains functional even if ZTncui is misconfigured

## Building

The project builds successfully with:
```bash
./gradlew assembleDebug
```

Output APK: `app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`

## Testing

Manual testing should cover:
1. Network card display with no network connected
2. Network card display with network connected
3. Disconnect via switch
4. ZTncui settings configuration
5. Layout rendering on different screen sizes
6. Material 3 theme consistency

## Dependencies

No new dependencies were added. The implementation uses existing:
- Material Components library (already present)
- EventBus (already present)
- Standard Android SDK components

## API Compatibility

The ZTncui API client is designed to work with standard ZTncui installations. The API endpoints used:
- `POST /api/auth` - Authentication
- `GET /api/network/{networkId}/member` - Get network members

Note: The actual ZTncui API may vary. The implementation should be tested with a real ZTncui instance and adjusted as needed.
